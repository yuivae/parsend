A File Manager with the purpose of follow up, and data control.

1. Create Case - Here you'll be able to add multiple items to your case list. These items will have titles, descriptions and attachments as their properties.
   Once you finish describing the case you can create it and have it listed on "Cases" page.

2. Cases - Here you'll find all the cases you created. You can click on the edit icon next to each case and edit the items and save them.

LATER ON: Approval feature will be added to approve or disapprove cases. Based on their approval state there will be a filter option on the Cases page where you'll be able to monitor only the disapproved, or approved cases.
